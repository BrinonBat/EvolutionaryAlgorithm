# EvolutionaryAlgorithm
Evolutionary Algorithm used to solve the one-max problem. It can be used for any problem which data structure is a binary vector

### TODO
 - [x] basic structure
 - [x] save system
 - [x] plot system
 - [x] end conditions
 - [ ] mutation functions
 - [x] fitness functions
 - [ ] selection functions
 - [ ] mutation functions
 - [ ] list configurations to be tested
 - [ ] tests et data gathering
 - [ ] make a new version with evolutive changes
 - [ ] tests on it
 - [ ] read papers about the problem and state of the art solutions
 - [ ] new versions 

 ### About versions

 Versions have the following pattern: 
 
 for X.Y.Z
 X = structure version
 Y = set of functions used version
 Z {0,5} : 0 = ordered by fitness , 5 = ordered by age (youngest first)
